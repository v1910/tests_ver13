In the passive voice,\n \nemphasis is put on the effect of an action rather than on the doer.\n\nThe letter will be sent tomorrow.\n\nThe work will be done on time.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s refresh the Future Simple structure with the Active Voice:\n\n[subject] + will + verb without \u2018to\u2019\n\nTo make statements with the Future Simple Passive, use:\n\n[subject] + will be + the Past Participle form of the verb\n\nFuture Simple Passive forms are normally built using \u2018will\u2019 rather than \u2018going to\u2019:\n\nThe motorway will be closed for three days.\n\nYour room will be cleaned while you are out.\n\nOnly English will be spoken at the conference.\n\nI will be treated\n\nYou will be treated\n\nThe new university will be opened by the President.\n\nThe contract will be signed tomorrow.\n\nThe documents will all be signed by next week.\n\nWe use Future Simple Passive for actions or events that will happen\n\nin future (tomorrow, next week (month, year), in 2020).\n\nUnlike the Future Perfect Passive, there\u2019s no deadline here.\n\nIn such statements we focus attention on the person or thing\n\naffected by the action, when the subject is unknown, unclear or irrelevant.\n\n',R20:"\n<h3>Present perfect passive construction</h3>\n\nPresent perfect passive construction: has/have + been + past participle\n \nExample verb: visit\n\nI have been visited  \n\nWe have been visited\n\nYou have been visited \n \nYou (guys) have been visited\n\nHe/she/it has been visited  \n\nThey have been visited\n\nThe agent is unknown.
